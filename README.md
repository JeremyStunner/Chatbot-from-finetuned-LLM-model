This is a project on Building a chatbot that answers questions based on specific data fed to the model.
This was done by finetuning an LLM (Openai) model with a personalized text data
This was possible with the use of Langchain framework in designing the prompt and chains needed to finetune the data.
In the end, we built a model that can answer questions about "feature Scaling" which is the pdf data we used in finetuning the openai model.
The Pdf file was loaded into the environment using PyPDF loader.
A PDF of the google collab notebook was attached to this repository which shows the codes and the final model built.
below is the google collab link to the code
